This is my thesis project, I combine Deep mutual learning and teaching assistant knowledge distillation
## Deep mutual learning:
Description:
[Original paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1706.00384.pdf)
[Author's code](https://github.com/YingZhangDUT/Deep-Mutual-Learning)

## Teaching assistant knowledge distillation:
Description:
[Original paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1902.03393.pdf)
[Author's code](https://github.com/imirzadeh/Teacher-Assistant-Knowledge-Distillation)

This repo is based on the PyTorch implementation of Deep mutual learning from [this repo](https://github.com/chxy95/Deep-Mutual-Learning)
